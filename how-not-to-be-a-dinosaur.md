# How to _not_ be a dinosaur. And not give a fuck.

This is my story about how I became an experienced senior frontend developer and how I had to start all over again. How it feltlike I had to start all over. How to learn. 

This story is mostly about React, but might apply to other languages as well. Heck, it might even apply to completely different areas of expertise.

## What happened? 

It is 2019 now and I am 37 years old. I have been working for 15+ years professionally as a webdeveloper and -designer. After highschool I went to design school and learned to be a designer. But I have also always been interested in coding. In the early 90's I was already writing code in [GW-Basic](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC). I can recall writing my first lines of code in the last grade of primary school. Later I learned HTML and even a little PHP 3. In design school I also learned Flash and OOP in [Lingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(programming_language)). When my class got the task to code a simple dice rolling program, I wrote the complete Monopoly game. Just because writing code was a never ending path of discovery and wonder. And [a dose of dopamine](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2014/10/24/357811146/curiosity-it-may-have-killed-the-cat-but-it-helps-us-learn?t=1572532599814).

_This is not me._

In the years working as a developer I have seen the landscape around me change drastically. Where I started designing and writing CSS and some javascript in the early 2000's, and in 2006 adding jQuery to my skills, this was kinda all I needed to master as a frontender. Oh, and also some backend code (PHP and even Coldfusion in a dark era) to be able to integrate your frontend code with the backend. So for years I could design a project, code it and integrate it. At one point I was named a full stack developer. Life was simple. Even simpler when post processors like SCSS came to life. I was like "I got this, bro!"

_Also not me._

## So what changed?

So I was happily writing SCSS, JS and some PHP, but then around 2012 the world started to change around me. I saw more and more articles about fancy frameworks like angular on Twitter. At some point it looked like every day there were new frameworks and released. I was naturally drawn to this, but couldn't keep up and got a little overwhelmed by the seaming compexity of some of these frameworks. And also I suffered a bit of [metathesiophobia](https://www.fearof.net/fear-of-change-phobia-metathesiophobia/).

_Still not me._ 

Also one day I attended a meetup where some guy enthausiastically demonstrated AngularJS. He made a list of hospital employees which could be clicked and then unfolded a list of their certifications and skills. A very simple page. And the amount of code that was shipped to make this simple page work was over 1mb.

So that was it for me. This new stuff is overly complex, scary and most of all: I could write this accordion list in less than 1kb of vanilla JS. Or maybe even without JS in CSS and HTML only… My common sense said: "Why the **** would you use something só complex for something só simple?!"

And at that time I was the only frontend developer in the company I work for. And I have always been the only frontend developer for all my previous employers. So there was nobody to convince me that it would be wise to embrace these new techniques.

## Why I stood still for so long

And late 2015, when I was already late to the party I got sick. A severe burnout and a big fallback one year later while I was still recovering. And when I felt a bit better, I came back to the office everything changed. There were two new frontend developers. With new repo's. New code. New words. New everything.

It was 2017 already. I did not know where to start. I didn't dare to ask for help, because of my misplaced pride. I was writing code before some of my new colleagues were even born… and now I should go to these guys and admit I had no clue what I was doing?

But I tried… I tried to keep up with it for a few months and then I was like: "I don't get it! fuck this shit!" 

I have been doing design ánd development 50/50 for all of my carreer, so now it's time to say goodbye to one of these and focus on the other. And since I got só scared of The New Frontend World, I choose design. This was in early 2018.

![](/public/johan_drawing.png)
_Nope. Not me either._

And after a year of doing (UX) design, I found out this was the wrong choice. Years of intensive therapy and running into a black hole that was another potential burnout, I came to the conclusion that design was not for me. I can design, but I can't handle the stress that goes with it. 

And then it was late 2018. I decided to get back to frontend development.

_Yes this is me._

## How to get up to speed? 

Now I faced a big challenge. How to get up to speed after being paused for a few years in a world that changed (and still is changing) so fast? First thing to overcome was my aversion for The New Frontend World. I tried to look at React and all new tools with a fresh and unbiased view.

While I was away in design world a lot has changed within our codebase, but also in The Frontend World. The tools we used improved or were replaced with better alternatives. The tools and codebase became more solid and mature.

Then there was news. React Hooks was about to be released. Which made code só much more readable that I started thinking "Hmm, maybe I can do this".  

After this "challenge accepted!" point the hardest obstacle had to be overwon: how to handle the "I have to start all over again" feeling. I felt like I knew nothing. I was Jon Snow.

## Dem feelings...

Who had I been kidding all these years calling myself a senior developer? How emberrassing was it that I had to ask my 12 years younger colleague for help over and over again...

Some people will think "what's the big deal?", and I am happy for you if you do, but you have to understand that asking help was a big issue for me. And a major cause for my burn out and personality disorder that came with it.

So I did two things: I decided to start learning all these new tools and code, but more importantly I started to ask for help. And the best thing I did: I told my colleagues how I was feeling and how insecure I was about everything. They responded very well to this and this gave me the confidence to go for it.

Also, I realised I did not have to start all over again. It might have felt like it, but I still had a big headstart with the years of experience in programming overall. It's just a new language and new tools I needed to learn, not learning how to speak and not the first tool I ever used.

It will take some time to learn all these new things. And that's okay. Good things take time. I should have realised this earlier since it's litteraly written on my body, but sadly it's not that obvious sometimes.

![](/public/johan_arm.png)
_Yes, this is also me._

## … okay great, no fucks given, but what then?

First I made a list of all the tools we use. It was quite a list with Typescript, Babel, Webpack, React, Apollo, Redux, GraphQL, Yarn and many more. This list was quite overwhelming, but then I started to put them into two groups: things I needed to learn right from the start and things I can figure out later. Turns out the first list is not that big and seemed do-able.

I now know how to set up a project using Babel, but I have no idea about the inner workings tho. And that's okay. I will learn it some day. Until then it's perfecgtly fine to ask a colleague who does get it.

Bottomline is that it is okay to not know things. It's not the amount of things you know that make you a senior developer, it's the way you handle things[that make you a senior](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-be-a-good-senior-developer-958948e02ada). In my opinion.

I have always used to take some time for personal growth once in a while, but this was only a few spare hours now and then, but since a few months our company is doing so called "Ship-it" days where we developers can do whatever we want as long as it's somehow work related. This is a great way for me to learn stuff I might not naturally learn during everyday work. When I work in our normal codebase I just run `yarn dev` and storybook starts and that's it. But on these ship-it days I make new repo's, install packages and set them up. That is a great way to learn new things.

## Conclusion

Take your time: good things take time.

Be yourself. 

Be awesome.
